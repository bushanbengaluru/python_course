            Method overriding in Python occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its parent class. When a method with the same name and signature (parameters) exists in both the parent and child classes, the child class's method overrides the parent class's method. This mechanism allows for customized behavior in subclasses while maintaining the structure of the parent class
