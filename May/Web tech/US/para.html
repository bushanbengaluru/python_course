    Method overriding in Python occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its parent class. This mechanism allows a subclass to modify or extend the behavior of an inherited method without altering the parent class itself. The overridden method in the subclass must have the same name and parameters as the method in the parent class.
